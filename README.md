# uk.co.mjwconsult.mjwtweaks
This is a collection of small but useful tweaks that I apply to all sites.

## Log API to get entries from civicrm_log
- log.get retrieves entries from civicrm_log.
- log.lastmodified gets the lastmodified details as an array for an entity ID and table.

## CSS Style changes
A custom stylesheet css/shoreditch.css is loaded so that the shoreditch theme works properly and the uk.squiffle.kam menu displays properly.

## Links
- The "Manage" link on contact case tab opens in a new tab.
